## Introduction: 
* Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Problems: 
* You need to identify what the major problems are, explain how you
have analyzed the problem, and present any facts you are using to support
your findings

## Solutions: 
* Outline a solution that would alleviate the problem and have a few alternatives in mind to show that you have given the case study considerable thought. Donâ€™t forget to include pros and cons for each solution.

## Conclusion: 
* End your presentation by summarizing key takeaways of all of the
problem-solving you conducted, highlighting what you have learned from this.

## Next steps: 
* Choose the best solution and propose recommendations for the client or business to take. Explain why you made your choice and how this will affect the scenario in a positive way. Be specific and include what needs to be done, who should enforce it, and when.
