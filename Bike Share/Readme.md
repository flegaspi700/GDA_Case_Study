## Introduction: 
* Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the marketing analyst team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Problems: 
* The main problem we need to solve is how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

## Solutions: 
* An analysis has been done on the trip data from Jan, 2021 to March, 2021. 
* We performed analysis on the duration of rides between Members and Casual users.

## Conclusion: 
* Based on our analysis I have 2 main points:
  *   Members have the most number of usage of the bikes but non members have the highest average duration on a weekly basis. 
  *   Casual users use the bikers longer than members on a weekly basis. 
* As a conclusion Cyclistic marketing team should focus on converting casual riders to members.

## Next steps: 
* I will perform additional analysis by location, so I can formulate recommendations by location.
